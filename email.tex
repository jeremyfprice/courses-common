\section{Stay Current by Keeping In Touch Outside of Class}

\newthought{Communications between me and you} outside of class will occur over email. Please do not send me a message through Blackboard. Please make sure to check your Fairmont State email on a regular basis (at least 4-5 times per week). If you do not have a smart phone, a computer or internet access at home or in your dorm room, make it a regular practice to go to the library and check your email there.
