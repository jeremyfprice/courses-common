\section{Learn More by Submitting Assignments}
\newthought{It is important to submit assignments on time} as a professional courtesy to yourself, your professor, and your classmates. All assignments are due in TaskStream before \textit{Pumpkin Hour}\footnote{\textit{Pumpkin Hour} is 11:59pm on the day the assignment is due.}. It is best not to wait until the Very Last Minute to submit assignments on \texttt{TaskStream}, as the submission process requires several steps.

I completely understand that life happens and emergencies, illnesses, and other situations come up when you least want them to.\marginnote{The \textit{Things Happen Buffer} gives you a little wriggle-room when it comes to handling the things that come up in life. Make sure to send me an email within \emph{24 hours} after the due date if something comes up. The sooner you contact me the better.} If you are involved in an emergency, illness, or situation, please inform me via email as soon as possible, preferably before the due date, and we can discuss an extension. I also understand that things may happen on the date an assignment is due, so every student in the course has a \textit{Things Happen Buffer}.
