\subsection{Building Trust: \enquote{Ooops!} Days}
You might forget me to send me an email, so \textbf{each teacher candidate in the course receives two "Ooops!" days.} Each unexcused absence beyond your two "Ooops!" days will result in 50 points taken off your final grade for the course.\marginnote{If you earned an B in the course but had two unexcused absences beyond your two "Ooops!" days, you will receive a C for your final grade.} \emph{If you need to be excused from class for an extended period of time} for a particular reason, you must speak to me directly outside of class\textemdash{}such as during my drop-in hours, or if you can't come at those times, schedule an appointment with me\textemdash{}so that we can work out a way for you to participate in the structure and activities of the course. I will be posting your attendance status on TaskStream each month.

\newthought{The most important thing is to keep an open line of communications open with me:} I am here to help you succeed. I recognize that students are required to miss class for many different reasons. The important thing to remember is to keep an open line of communications with me so your grade is not adversely affected.
